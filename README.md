Student Management System
 This Student Management System is a web-based application built using Java technologies. It provides a simple interface for managing student information, including adding, editing, updating, and deleting student records. The project is structured as a Maven project, leveraging several key technologies

 Key Technologies:
        
• JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for creating dynamic web pages and handling user input.        
• Servlets: Serve as the controller layer, managing requests and responses between the client and server.        
• DAO (Data Access Object): Handles the database operations, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.        
• JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): Simplifies the development of JSP pages with standard tags for common tasks.        
• Maven: Used for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.        
• Bootstrap: A front-end framework used for designing responsive and mobile-first web pages.    

  Features  
        
• Add New Student: Input details such as name, date of birth, address, qualification, and email.        
• Edit Student Information: Modify existing student records.        
• View Student List: Display a list of all students with an option to view individual details.        
• Delete Student: Remove student records from the database.        
• Form Validation: Ensures that user inputs are validated before submission.    


Future Enhancements:
